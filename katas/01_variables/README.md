# Variables

In C programming, variables are named box that hold data, which can be of different types 
like integer, decimal number, character, etc., and whose values can be modified during program execution.

You have to declare your variable with its type and name, you will not be able to change them after.
For example, let's declare a variable to store an age: `int age = 3;`.
Actually, what we have just done is two things in one : declaration AND assigning.
You can do those two things separately, first declare `int age;` then assign `age = 3;`.
The first assigning is called 'initialisation' and we advise to always declare and initialise at the same time.

You can change the value in the box, it is just a reassignment : `age = 10`.
